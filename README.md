## How to run the VisualBert model 

There are 2 main Jupyter notebooks where all the job is done and documented:
- The *'reproducing results'* notebook --> [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1kAYFd50XvFnLO-k9FU9iLM21J8djTo-Q?usp=sharing)
- The *'end-to-end'* notebook --> [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1O0m0j9_NBInzdo3K04jD19IyOhBR1I8i?usp=sharing)

The first notebook is only for reproducing the results of Phase-2 submissions by the team `HateDetectron`. In other words, just loading the final models and getting predictions for the test set. See the [*end-to-end* notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1O0m0j9_NBInzdo3K04jD19IyOhBR1I8i?usp=sharing) to have a look at the whole approach in detail: how the models are trained, how the image features are extracted, which datasets are used, etc.

## How to run Vilio model
The steps to run and reproduce the results of the Vilio model can be found [here](vilio/SCORE_REPRO.md).
